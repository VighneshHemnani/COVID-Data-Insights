# COVID-Data-Insights
A MySQL project that focused on gathering, filtering, stripping and analysing hundreds of thousands of data points from world data banks found online to make out interesting trends. This is was a project from a Rutgers CS336 (Principles of Information and Data Mangement) course taught by Professor Tomasz Imieli≈Ñski. 

In this repo, you will find the PDF with the findings, different variables and the queries run along with a folder that contains all the raw data used for analysis in this project.
